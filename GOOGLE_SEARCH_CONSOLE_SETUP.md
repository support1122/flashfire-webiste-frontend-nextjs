# 🔍 Google Search Console Setup Guide

## 📋 What You Need to Do in Google Search Console

After deploying your new Next.js site, follow these steps to ensure Google continues indexing your site properly and maintains your SEO rankings.

---

## ✅ Step 1: Verify Site Ownership (If New Property)

### If you're creating a new property:
1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Click **"Add Property"**
3. Enter: `https://www.flashfirejobs.com`
4. Choose verification method:
   - **HTML file upload** (download file, upload to `/public/` folder)
   - **HTML tag** (add to `app/layout.tsx` in `<head>`)
   - **DNS record** (if you have domain access)
   - **Google Analytics** (if already connected)

### If property already exists:
- No action needed, just proceed to Step 2

---

## ✅ Step 2: Submit New Sitemap

### Current Sitemap:
- **URL:** `https://www.flashfirejobs.com/sitemap.xml`
- **Status:** Auto-generated by Next.js from `app/sitemap.ts`

### Steps:
1. Go to **Sitemaps** in left sidebar
2. In "Add a new sitemap" field, enter: `sitemap.xml`
3. Click **"Submit"**
4. Wait for Google to process (usually within a few hours)

### What to Expect:
- ✅ Status: "Success" - Sitemap processed successfully
- ⚠️ Status: "Couldn't fetch" - Wait 24-48 hours, then check again
- ❌ Status: "Has errors" - Check the errors and fix them

---

## ✅ Step 3: Request Re-indexing of Important Pages

### Priority Pages to Re-index:
1. **Homepage:** `https://www.flashfirejobs.com/`
2. **Pricing:** `https://www.flashfirejobs.com/pricing`
3. **Blogs:** `https://www.flashfirejobs.com/blogs`
4. **Canada Homepage:** `https://www.flashfirejobs.com/en-ca`
5. **Canada Pricing:** `https://www.flashfirejobs.com/en-ca/pricing`

### Steps:
1. Go to **URL Inspection** tool (top search bar)
2. Enter each URL above
3. Click **"Request Indexing"**
4. Wait for "URL is on Google" confirmation

**Note:** Don't request indexing for all pages at once. Start with 5-10 most important pages.

---

## ✅ Step 4: Monitor Coverage Report

### Check for Issues:
1. Go to **Coverage** in left sidebar
2. Check for:
   - ❌ **Errors** - Pages that can't be indexed
   - ⚠️ **Warnings** - Pages with issues but still indexed
   - ✅ **Valid** - Pages indexed successfully
   - 📄 **Excluded** - Pages intentionally excluded

### What to Look For:
- **404 errors** - Broken links (should be minimal if URLs match old site)
- **Redirect errors** - If you changed any URLs
- **Server errors** - Backend issues
- **Robots.txt blocking** - Check if robots.txt is blocking important pages

---

## ✅ Step 5: Verify robots.txt

### Check robots.txt is Accessible:
1. Go to **Settings** → **robots.txt Tester**
2. Enter: `https://www.flashfirejobs.com/robots.txt`
3. Verify it shows:
   ```
   User-agent: *
   Allow: /
   Sitemap: https://www.flashfirejobs.com/sitemap.xml
   ```

### Test Important URLs:
- Test your homepage URL
- Test a few other important pages
- Ensure they're not blocked

---

## ✅ Step 6: Check Mobile Usability

### Verify Mobile-Friendly:
1. Go to **Mobile Usability** in left sidebar
2. Check for any mobile errors
3. Fix any issues found

**Your Next.js site should be mobile-responsive**, but it's good to verify.

---

## ✅ Step 7: Monitor Performance (After 1-2 Weeks)

### Check Search Performance:
1. Go to **Performance** in left sidebar
2. Monitor:
   - **Impressions** - Should remain stable or increase
   - **Clicks** - Should remain stable
   - **Average Position** - Should not drop significantly
   - **CTR** - Click-through rate

### What to Watch For:
- 📉 **Drop in impressions/clicks** - May indicate indexing issues
- 📉 **Drop in average position** - May need time to stabilize
- ✅ **Stable or improving metrics** - Good sign!

---

## ✅ Step 8: Set Up URL Parameters (If Needed)

### If you use UTM parameters:
1. Go to **Settings** → **URL Parameters**
2. Add parameters you want Google to ignore:
   - `utm_source`
   - `utm_medium`
   - `utm_campaign`
   - `utm_content`
   - `utm_term`

**Note:** This prevents duplicate content issues from UTM parameters.

---

## ✅ Step 9: Submit Change of Address (If Domain Changed)

### Only if you changed domains:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Change of Address**
2. Enter old domain and new domain
3. Submit the change

**Your case:** You're keeping the same domain (`flashfirejobs.com`), so **skip this step**.

---

## ✅ Step 10: Monitor for 2-4 Weeks

### Weekly Checks:
- ✅ Coverage report for new errors
- ✅ Performance metrics
- ✅ Indexing status of important pages
- ✅ Any manual actions or security issues

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

### 1. **Don't Panic if Rankings Drop Temporarily**
- Google needs time to re-crawl and re-index
- Temporary drops are normal during migrations
- Should stabilize within 2-4 weeks

### 2. **Keep Old Site Running (If Possible)**
- Keep old Vercel project running for 24-48 hours
- This gives Google time to discover the new site
- Then you can safely shut down the old one

### 3. **Monitor Both Properties (If Applicable)**
- If you have both `flashfirejobs.com` and `www.flashfirejobs.com`
- Monitor both in Search Console
- Ensure canonical URLs point to preferred version

### 4. **Check for Manual Actions**
- Go to **Security & Manual Actions** → **Manual Actions**
- Should show "No issues detected"
- If issues found, address them immediately
